snake-js improved
========

Play snake on top of any webpage with HTML5 canvas.

The only dependency is jQuery.

To enable in a webpage, copy and paste the following:
    
    <script src="path/to/snake.js"></script>
    <script>Snake.run();</script>

To install as a bookmarklet, copy and paste `bookmarklet.min.js` into a bookmark URL, prefixed with `javascript:`.
